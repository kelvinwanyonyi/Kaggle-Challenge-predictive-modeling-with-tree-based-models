Kaggle Challenge-predictive modeling with tree-based models
 # Decision Trees
# Core Competencies
- Objective 01 - clean data with outliers and missing values
- Objective 02 - use scikit-learn for decision trees
- Objective 03 - get and interpret feature importances of a tree-based model

 # Random Forests
# Core Competencies
- Objective 01 - use scikit-learn for random forests
- Objective 02 - implement ordinal encoding with high-cardinality categoricals
- Objective 03 - understand how categorical encodings affect trees differently compared to linear models
- Objective 04 - understand how tree ensembles reduce overfitting compared to a single decision tree with unlimited depth

# Module 3 - Cross-validation
# Core Competencies
- Objective 01 - implement cross-validation with independent test set
- Objective 02 - use scikit-learn for hyperparameter optimization
# Classification Metrics
# Core Competencies
- Objective 01 - get and interpret the confusion matrix for classification models
- Objective 02 - use the classification metrics of precision and recall
- Objective 03 - understand the relationships between precision, recall, thresholds, and predicted probabilities
